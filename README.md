**FormulateBRD** is an AI-powered pipeline designed to bridge the gap between unstructured business communication and structured software requirements. It automates the extraction and formalization of business needs into enterprise-ready **Business Requirements Documents (BRDs)**, reducing ambiguity and accelerating project kick-off.

## 🧠 The Agentic Pipeline

FormulateBRD operates on a strict **3-stage analytical workflow** to ensure high-fidelity outputs over creative assumptions.

1. **Requirement Analysis**: The system deconstructs raw input (emails, chats, notes) into factual nodes—Business Problems, Objectives, Stakeholders, and Explicit Requirements—without making guesses.
2. **BRD Generation**: Analysis data is transformed into a formal document using standardized enterprise headers, ensuring consistent formatting and professional language.
3. **Validation & Clarification**: The final stage performs a gap analysis, identifying ambiguities or missing metrics and generating a list of actionable "Clarification Questions" for stakeholders.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📧 Business Simulation**: Integrated with the **Enron Email Dataset** to allow instant testing and demonstration using real-world enterprise communication.
- **🌓 Enterprise UI**: High-density interface with support for **Dark/Light modes**, built using the Inter and Outfit typography systems.
